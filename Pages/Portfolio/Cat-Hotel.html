        <h1>Cat Hotel (CFG Project)</h1>
        <p>This whacky concept was created by me and two other girls Danielle and Keeley as part of the Web Development course run by <u><a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/">Code First Girls</a></u>.</p>
        <p>The concept behind this was to create a website that appeared as a business site advertising a luxury Cattery.</p>
        <p>This project was really fun to work on, as it allowed us to bring creativity to a professional setting. To ensure a smooth process when collaborating our ideas, we created our design in Figma to start with. (I have added a screenshot of some of the templates below.)</p>
        <img src="/Images/cfg-figma-prev.png">
        <p>When building the site, we ensured to use GitHub so that when changes were made we were all still working on the most recent version.</p>
        <p>I had been working with CSS and HTML inside and outside of work prior to this course, but it helped me cement my knowledge and gain insight into useful features like Figma and GitHub.</p>
        <p>This website was our final project for the course and was presented in our final week in Jan. 2023. </p>
